# Yoga Natural
Yoga Natural is my first project ( Portfolio 1 ). It is a website designed to promote a yoga studio and it's classes for future and currently students. The main target are people who are interested in starting practicing yoga and people that already have experienced and are looking for advanced or specific classes to continue to improve.

## UX
My primary goal was to ensure that oth new users and experienced users on yoga practice would be confortable using the website across differents types os screen and devices all while enjoying a clean and minimalist design focusing on soft colors and not overwhelming the users with unnecessary information.
The main colors used were purple, pink for logo, black for text and white for background to bring a calm and relaxing website.

### Target Audience
* Users new to Yoga.
* Users already experienced in Yoga practice.
* Users interested in wellness and wellbeing and health lifestyle in general.

### First Time Users
* As a user, I'm looking to find out about yoga classes and its diferences.
* As a first time visitor I need to be able to understand, navigate and find what i'm looking easily.
* As a user  I want to be able to reach out and ask questions if needed.
* As a first time user I want to be able to see pictures of the place ad the classes.

### Returning Users
* As a returning user I want to be able to find the classes that interested me.
* As a returning user I want to know all classes available and the differences between each.
* As a returning user I want to be able to contact the studio if necessary.

### Frequent Users
* Frequent users would have the same needs as a returning user.
