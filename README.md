# Yoga Natural
Yoga Natural is my first project ( Portfolio 1 ). It is a website designed to promote a yoga studio and it's classes for future and currently students. The main target are people who are interested in starting practicing yoga and people that already have experienced and are looking for advanced or specific classes to continue to improve.

## UX
My primary goal was to ensure that oth new users and experienced users on yoga practice would be confortable using the website across differents types os screen and devices all while enjoying a clean and minimalist design focusing on soft colors and not overwhelming the users with unnecessary information.
The main colors used were purple, pink for logo, black for text and white for background to bring a calm and relaxing website.
